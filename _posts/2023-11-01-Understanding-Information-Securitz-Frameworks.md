## What is an IT security framework?

**Security frameworks** are guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risks and threats to data and privacy. Security frameworks provide a structured approach to implementing a security lifecycle. The security lifecycle is a constantly evolving set of policies and standards that define how an organization manages risks, follows established guidelines, and meets regulatory
compliance, or laws. 

There are several security frameworks that may be used to manage different types of organizational and regulatory compliance risks. The purpose of security frameworks include protecting personally identifiable information, known as PII, securing financial information, identifying security weaknesses, managing organizational risks, and aligning security with business goals. Frameworks have four core components and understanding them will allow you to better manage potential risks. 

The first core component is **identifying and documenting security goals.**

This component is used to determine the cybersecurity targets an organization seeks to reach. These objectives are unique to each organization and are largely shaped by the business's cybersecurity expertise, overall strategic goals, and any specific regulatory requirements that must be met.

For instance, an organization that handles peopleâ€™s credit card information may have a goal to get PCI DSS certified in order to follow the right procedures. The PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) is an information security standard designed to reduce payment card fraud by increasing security controls around cardholder data.

The second core component is **setting guidelines to achieve security goals.**

This stage involves the meticulous development of a list comprising functions, processes, and actions dedicated to accomplishing the goals outlined in the identification phase. It also encompasses measures to prioritize these goals and establish clear roles and responsibilities for each defined objective.

An organization aiming for PCI DSS compliance may create a comprehensive list of functions, processes, and actions such as  implementing encryption protocols for cardholder data during transactions, conducting regular vulnerability scans, and establishing incident response procedures. Roles and responsibilities could be defined, designating specific teams or individuals to manage encryption protocols, conduct scans, and respond to security incidents.

The third core component of security frameworks is **implementing strong security processes.**
So the organization in question is an ecommerce company, they may develop procedures to secure cardholder data by designing  protocols for encrypting payment information during online transactions.

This represents the implementation phase of the framework, where every goal is put into effect within the organization. Effective communication is pivotal during this stage, given that applied cybersecurity processes typically span across multiple areas or departments.

The last core component of security frameworks is **monitoring and communicating results.** 

Finally, the implemented objectives undergo continuous monitoring, documentation, and review to ascertain the effectiveness of the cybersecurity framework processes. Findings are communicated to the organization, and ongoing efforts are made to enhance and refine existing processes and objectives.

As an example, you might actively monitor your company's payment processing systems and promptly report any potential security issues to your manager


Next we will discuss some examples of security frameworks.
