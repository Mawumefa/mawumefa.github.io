## Examples of Information Security Frameworks - Part 2

Welcome back again, in the last post, we discussed 5 information security frameworks, we will continue to discuss more in this post, lets begin……. 

**SOC 1 and SOC 2**

SOC 1 and SOC 2 are part of the Service Organization Control (SOC) reporting platform, developed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). 

SOC 1 is primarily focused on controls relevant to financial reporting. It is designed for service organizations that handle financial transactions or provide services that could impact their clients' financial statements.

SOC 2 is broader in scope and focuses on the security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy of information at a service organization. It is not specifically tied to financial reporting but is more concerned with the overall security and privacy of data.

**TISAX**

The Trusted Information Security Assessment Exchange, is a framework for information security assessments in the automotive industry. TISAX was developed by the Verband der Automobilindustrie (VDA), the German Association of the Automotive Industry, to establish a standardized and secure approach to handling information security in the supply chain.

TISAX assessments are conducted at different levels, known as assessment levels (L1 to L3). The level chosen depends on the sensitivity and criticality of the information being handled. Higher assessment levels indicate more stringent security requirements.

Organizations operating in the automotive sector can undergo TISAX assessments, to evaluate and demonstrate the maturity of their information security management systems (ISMS).

**COBIT**

The Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies (COBIT), is a framework that provides a comprehensive set of guidelines and best practices for IT governance and management. The framework is used by organizations to align IT processes with business objectives, manage risks and ensure that IT processes are effective, efficient, and provide measurable value. 

It was developed by ISACA (Information Systems Audit and Control Association) in 1996, the latest version is COBIT 2019, released in 2018 which offers users flexible solutions that can adjust to the dynamic technological changes in today's IT landscape.

**HIPAA**

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) is a United States of America federal law enacted in 1996 designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the healthcare system.

It ensures the privacy and security of individuals' health information, and establishes national standards for the protection of electronic health information.

HIPAA is crucial in protecting patients' privacy and ensuring the security of their health information. Covered entities and their business associates are required to comply with HIPAA regulations, and non-compliance can result in significant penalties. 

**NERC-CIP**

NERC CIP stands for North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP). It is a non-profit organization that ensures the reliability and security of the North American bulk power system. The Critical Infrastructure Protection standards developed by NERC are designed to secure the assets required for operating North America's bulk electric systems.

The NERC CIP standards include a set of requirements for the identification and protection of critical cyber assets, as well as the detection of cybersecurity events. They also cover the response to and recovery from incidents. The standards apply to entities that are responsible for the operation and planning of the bulk power system.
