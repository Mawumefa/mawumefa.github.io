## Examples of Information Security Frameworks - Part 1

Now that we know what information security frameworks are, let's talk about the some examples of the frameworks! 

**ISO 27000 Series**

The ISO 27000 series is a set of international standards developed and published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). The series provides a framework of best practices and guidelines for information security, covering various aspects of organizational processes, technology, and people.  It was designed to help organizations establish and maintain effective Information Security Management Systems (ISMS). 

The primary standard within this series is ISO/IEC 27001 which was first published in October 2005 and revised in October 2013 to better accommodate the changing information security challenges and then again in 2022.

Followed by ISO/IEC 27002 or Annex A which provides a set of guidelines and best practices for selecting, implementing, and managing information security controls. ISO 27002 was formerly known as ISO 17799 which was based on the British standard BS 7799-1. The current version is ISO 27002:2022.

**NIST Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF)**

The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) is a flexible set of guidelines and practices developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology to help organizations, in response to Executive Order 13636. This order, signed by President Barack Obama in 2013, aimed at improving the cybersecurity of critical infrastructure in the United States. 

The NIST CSF provides a voluntary and adaptable approach for organizations to enhance their cybersecurity resilience, offering guidelines for risk management, information sharing, and the protection of critical infrastructure.

The NIST CSF manages risk by aligning security controls with five key functions: Identify,  Protect , Detect , Respond, and Recover. This structured approach enables organizations to enhance cybersecurity resilience.

**NIST Special Publications (NIST SP)**

NIST Special Publications (NIST SP) are a series of documents produced by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) that provide in-depth guidance, recommendations, and standards on various aspects of technology and cybersecurity. 

The series is commonly identified by numbers, and some well-known subseries include the 800 series, 500 series, and 1800 series:
The NIST SP 800 series - primarily focuses on computer security and information security
The NIST SP 500 series - encompasses publications related to information technology and computer security. 
The NIST SP 1800 series - focuses on cybersecurity practice guides, offering practical, actionable guidance for specific cybersecurity challenges. 

**GDPR**
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a comprehensive data protection and privacy regulation. It was adopted in 2016 and enforced in May 2018. It replaced Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC and is designed to strengthen and unify data protection for all individuals within the EU. 

GDPR aims to protect the privacy and fundamental rights of individuals while fostering a more
consistent and accountable approach to data processing across the EU. It has had a significant impact globally, as many organizations outside the EU must comply with its regulations when handling the personal data of EU citizens.

**PCI DSS**
PCI DSS stands for Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. It is a set of security standards designed to ensure that all companies that accept, process, store, or transmit credit card information maintain a secure environment. The standard is a collaborative effort developed by major credit card companies, including Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover, and JCB. The goal of PCI DSS is to protect cardholder data and secure the payment card infrastructure from breaches and theft.
