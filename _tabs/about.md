Hi, Iâ€™m Mawumefa (she/her), I am passionate about information security, project management, content creation and implementing information security frameworks.

My career has revolved around safeguarding data and systems, enforcing compliance to information security regulations, and ensuring the protection of organizations and the individuals they serve. I have a strong track record specializing in Governance, Risk Management and Compliance. 

As an Information Security Officer, I conducted comprehensive audits based on ISO 27001 standards, managed vulnerability assessments and mitigations, coordinated internal and external audits, and led the implementation of security recommendations. My efforts resulted in successful ISO 27001 and PCI DSS certifications and a reduction in security incidents. I have expert knowledge in ISO/IEC 2700X Standards, PCI DSS, NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) and DSGVO/GDPR. 

As an IT Project Manager I managed the entire lifecycle of multiple digital projects and ensured their success. I also focused on conducting security training and awareness programs.

Overall, I bring a wealth of experience and a strong skill set to any organization, coupled with a growth mindset, leadership abilities, and a commitment to excellence.
